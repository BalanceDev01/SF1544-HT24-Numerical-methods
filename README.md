# Projects from laboration work in SF1544-HT24-Numerical-methods

This repository consists of code and solutions to problems from SF1544 Numerical Methods, Basic Course IV 
This course I took in the 2nd cycle at KTH, involving:
Numerical methods for various types of linear systems of equations (full, triangular, banded), the least squares method for inconsistent systems, nonlinear equations (scalar and system), eigenvalue problem, integration, derivation, interpolation, and initial and boundary value problems for ODE. Basic technologies for numerical methods, such as iteration, linearisation, discretisation, and extrapolation, and theoretical concepts like order of accuracy, speed of convergence, complexity, condition, and stability.
